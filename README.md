# Finites at Fredy's

https://esolangs.org/wiki/Finites_at_Fredy%27s

Finites at Fredy's is a logic based scheduling language based around a simple, but universal, component: the Controlled Security With Animatronic Patrols (CSWAP) office. AKA "Fredy's".

It is intended to help kids learn about reversible computing concepts and provide a gentle introduction to the Quantum Circuit model through the familiar and comfortable medium of survival-horror, and jump-scare reinforced learning.
